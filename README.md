♯♯♯♯Say Yes If you don't say yes, the Kastamonu bear will be sad
Added interactive bear button game with happy bear GIF on 'Yes' click and moving 'No' button.
This project is a fun interactive webpage featuring a cute question: "Kastamonu ayısını seviyor musun?" with two buttons: "Yes(evet)" and "No(hayır)". Upon clicking the "Yes" button, the question changes to "Kastamonu ayısı mutlu!" and the GIF updates to a happy dancing bear. If the user hovers over the "No" button, it moves around randomly to avoid being clicked, adding an extra layer of fun. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
