# Say Yes or the Kastamonu Bear Will Be Sad

## Project Overview

This project is a fun and interactive webpage that asks the question: **"Kastamonu ayısını seviyor musun?"** ("Do you love the Kastamonu bear?"). The webpage presents two options:

- **Yes (Evet):** When clicked, the bear becomes happy, and the text changes to "Kastamonu ayısı mutlu!" ("The Kastamonu bear is happy!"). A joyful dancing bear GIF will appear, celebrating your love.
- **No (Hayır):** But wait! If you hover over the "No" button, it will try to escape, making it nearly impossible to click and leaving the bear potentially sad (but still safe!).

This project is a playful experiment built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases dynamic button interactions and simple yet effective use of animations.

## Features

1. **Interactive Buttons:** The "No" button moves around the screen when you try to click it.
2. **Dynamic Content:** The question and GIF update when you click "Yes."
3. **Responsive Design:** The page is styled to look good on all screen sizes.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
3. Try clicking "Yes" and see what happens.
4. Try to catch the "No" button if you can!

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for the structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for interactivity

## Why?

Because sometimes, it's fun to make a bear happy!

## Future Improvements

- Adding more playful animations
- Enhancing the design for even more immersive interactions
